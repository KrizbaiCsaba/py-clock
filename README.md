# py-clock
A Python clock made using Pygame

This is a personnal projet I made for myself and after some demands for the source code, I have uploaded it here.

The code is still only for Python 2.7, about 1/4 of the variable names are in french and the other 3/4 are in english.

Not too much cleanup has been made before uploading, there are still a lot of weird workarounds and magic numbers in there, be prepared.

## Customization
The animation on the right can be customized using the AnimationLoopSettings at the top.

There is a notification system that can be personnalised by modifying the `notifications` list.

Play around with the settings at the top and see what they can do!
